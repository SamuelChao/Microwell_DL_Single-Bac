## Brief Description
- Computer vision application of biomedical images with deep learning approaches.
- Purpose: “Deep Learning-Assisted Single-Bacterium Distinguishment in Microwell Array”
- Unet, Unet++ model constructed by tensorflow 
- Image segmentation task to identified the existence of bacteria trapped inside a microstructure called microwell in brightfield microscopy image
- Using Opencv python package to predict the bacteria number inside microwell
- Predict whether single-bacterium microwell occur
